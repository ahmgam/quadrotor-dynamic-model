# quadrotor-dynamic-model

this repo is a part of motion control course of my matset degree courses, the aim is to simulate the dynamic model of quadrotor using python
I made two trails, the first one I used control python library to simulate the dynamic model using Laplace approach 
and the second trail I used numerical approximations for all equations.
acutally : the both models have problems, but genrally, the first one outpreformed the second.
